<h1>1. Import the Required Libraries</h1>
<p>You should import Pandas (import pandas as pd) and Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt) for data manipulation and visualization.</p>
<p>Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.</p>
