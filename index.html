<h1>Exploring Titanic Dataset with Pandas</h1>
    
<h3>1. Import the Required Libraries</h3>
<p>You should import Pandas (import pandas as pd) and Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt) for data manipulation and visualization.</p>
<pre><code class = "python">
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        </code></pre>
<p>Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.</p>
